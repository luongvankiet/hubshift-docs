## Common Patterns Across Workflows

### Authentication
All workflows require user authentication. Users must:
1. Login via `/login`
2. Verify OTP via `/api/user/verifymailOTP`
3. Receive JWT token for authenticated requests

### User Roles
The system supports multiple user roles with different permissions:
- **Super Admin:** Full access to all features
- **Health Carer:** Can create appointments, add progress notes, view assigned clients
- **Client:** Can view their own data, submit forms, view appointments
- **Support Coordinator:** Can manage client goals and appointments
- **Supervisor:** Can manage incidents and review reports

### Common Actions
Most workflows include:
- **Create:** Add new records
- **View/List:** Browse existing records with filters
- **Edit/Update:** Modify existing records
- **Delete:** Remove records (usually soft delete)
- **Export:** Download data as PDF/CSV
- **Search/Filter:** Find specific records

### Navigation Patterns
- List pages typically have "Add New" buttons
- Detail pages have "Edit" and "Back" buttons
- Forms use Formik for validation
- Success/error messages use toast notifications
